I am interested in the treatment and classification of depression, including its classification and differentiation from normal sadness. My research has focused primarily on the outcomes and processes of change in depression treatments, especially cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs). An overarching theme informing my work is that the level of heterogeneity in the clinical presentation (e.g., symptoms) and in the prognosis of depression needs to be considered when studying etiology and treatments. My colleagues and I have worked on identifying, combining, and using patient-level variables to select what treatments would be optimal for a given patient. I am especially interested in using data to guide individuals to the level of care (e.g., watchful waiting vs. intensive psychotherapy) that would be most appropriate for them. Another line of my research focuses on the study of psychotherapy processes (i.e., how psychotherapy works), with a focus on the roles of the working alliance and cognitive change. Here we have also found evidence that individual differences need to be considered to fully understand process-outcome correlations. For example, in CBT the working alliance appears to be a strong predictor of change for patients with less recurrent depression but does not appear to predict outcome among cases of more recurrent depression.

My primary research interests focus on dissemination and implementation, specifically the implementation of measurement-based care in community settings, as well as the impact of traumatic experiences on functioning and emotion regulation. Currently I am working on a project assessing whether anxiety is a superior predictor of decreased functioning and well-being in individuals with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD).
