# Here are resources that the lab has studied for help with depression and anxiety! {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## **COMET behavioral activation (COMET-BA) 4-week program**

The links below take you to our 4-week COMET-BA program for depression. We make this free for everyone. You may have come here from Prolific if you were in the "weekly survey control group" part of our study or if were in the COMET-BA group and want to refresh the material. Or, maybe you just stumbled upon this on the web! In the study with over 800 online workers, we found that the intervention was effective in reducing depression, reducing anxiety, and improving how people function at work and school while also helping them manage their emotions better by looking at things from different perspectives and scheduling activities.

We recommend you do these in order and about a week apart because that's how we studied them!
