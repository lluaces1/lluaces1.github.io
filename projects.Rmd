Below are descriptions of projects that the lab has ongoing. We tried to organize them by theme but this is not an exact classification scheme. **Prof. Lorenzo-Luaces is the PI for the projects below, unless otherwise noted.** For all these projects we usually take special attention to *individual differences,* the idea that what may appear to be true, on average, may differ across groups of people.

## Reducing disparities in access to care

Psychological interventions are effective treatments for depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and other common mental health concerns. Despite this, it is very difficult for most people to access treatments because they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to find. We have several projects studying interventions that are not as expensive as face-to-face psychotherapy with trained therapists, including internet apps and books. The projects include:

### Leveraging computational social sciences and natural language processing to optimize engagement and response to low-intensity CBT for depression and anxiety

### Feasibility of stepped care with single-session interventions and guided self-help CBT

### Psychologists’ use of waiting lists and willingness to use low-intensity treatments (PI: Peipert)

### Barriers to internet-based CBT use (PI: Peipert)

### Racial-ethnic diversity in trials of internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (PI: De Jesús-Romero)

### Willingness of individuals to use different low-intensity treatments (PI: De Jesús-Romero)


## Emotion regulation and psychopathology

One commonality of depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and other common mental health concerns may be that people have a hard time regulating their emotions, especially negative emotions. When we conduct studies, we usually include measures of emotion regulation, usually the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross and John, 2003). The ERQ measures the habitual or regular use of two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Projects that specifically focus on emotion regulation include:

- Cognitive reappraisal of LGB-identity vs. non-LGB-identity stress in LGBT young adults (PI: De Jesús-Romero)
- Mechanisms of change in transdiagnostic guided self-help (PI: De Jesús-Romero)


##CHARACTERIZING HETEROGENEITY TO DEPRESSION
Surveys of Online Cohorts for Internalizing Symptoms and Language (SOCIaL) (with Co-PIs: Bollen, Rutter, and Valdez)



##CHARACTERIZING DEPRESSION AND OTHER INTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS IN SOCIAL MEDIA
Heterogeneity of depression and melancholia in clinical and nationally representative samples (PI: Buss)

Survey of Online Cohorts for Internalizing symptoms And Language (SOCIAL). In SOCIAL-I, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1121 U.S. adults and administered a transdiagnostic battery of symptom assessments. We also obtained their consent to access their social media accounts. The aim of the project is to triangulate self-reported mental health data and social media activity. SOCIAL-II is an ongoing study that has overlapping measures with SOCIAL-I but expands the assessments to include temperament and eating pathology. We’ve recruited at least 2,015 college students and continue to collect each semester.
