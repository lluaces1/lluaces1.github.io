## **COMET-Behavioral activation (BA) from Prolific study** 

COMET-BA is an online program that our research team is studying to help people reduce stress, sadness, and anxiety and improve their well-being. We studied COMET-BA in over 800 people across the U.S. and found it was effective for reducing depression and anxiety and increased people's abilities to cope well. In the program, you will be asked to read about and briefly practice a skill to improve your well-being. We designed the program to take ***about 10 minutes*** in each module. We recommend doing the modules one week apart, in order, and to spend time between each module to practice the exercises.

Good luck and thank you for your interest in our work
